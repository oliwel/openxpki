== Throwing Exceptions ==

== Catching Exceptions ==

When catching exceptions, the following code can be used as a template:

<pre>
eval {
 
  # code that may throw exceptions goes here

};
if ( my $exc = OpenXPKI::Exception->caught() ) {

  # In this block, you can handle specific errors

  if ( $exc->message() eq "I18N_OPENXPKI_ERROR_TO_CATCH" ) {

    # In this block, elegantly handle that specific error

  } else {

    # If the error is something else, re-throw it

    $exc->rethrow();

  } elsif ( $EVAL_ERROR ) {

    # In this block, there was no exception thrown, but the eval failed
    # anyway, so a new exception should be thrown

    OpenXPKI::Exception->throw(
      message => 'I18N_OPENXPKI_OTHER_ERROR_IN_EVAL',
      params => {
        'ERROR' => $EVAL_ERROR,
      }
    );
  }
} 
</pre>

''Note:'' Don't forget to "use English;" to have access to "$EVAL_ERROR".

== Example for SafeNet ExternalServer ==

SafeNet has two product lines as HSMs: SafeNet Luna SA (former Chrysalis) and SafeNet ExternalServer (former Eracom)

For the SafeNet ExternalServer here's a configuration template for [[Manual/Reference/Configuration/token.xml|token.xml]]:

the following example is untested yet:
<pre>
<token id="testdummyca1" super="../token(default)">
    <backend>OpenXPKI::Crypto::Backend::OpenSSL</backend>
    <engine>PKCS11</engine>
    <shell>/usr/bin/openssl</shell>
    <wrapper></wrapper>
    <randfile></randfile>
    <!-- This is the OpenSSL configuration to use the SafeNet API together with OpenSC and the SafeNet PKCS11 library (/opt/PTK)
         use /usr/lib/ instead of /usr/lib64/ if you use a 32-bit operating system -->
    <engine_section>
         pkcs11 = pkcs11_section

         [pkcs11_section]
         engine_id = pkcs11
         dynamic_path = /usr/lib64/engines/engine_pkcs11.so
         MODULE_PATH = /opt/PTK/lib/libcryptoki.so
         init = 0
    </engine_section>
    <!-- Use engine not for RAND (because i didn't have the time to test the OpenXPKI engine against this feature -->
    <engine_usage>PRIV_KEY_OPS</engine_usage>
    <key_store>ENGINE</key_store>
    <!-- Use SafeNet ExternalServer Slot "0" and Token "DemoRoot0" -->
    <key>slot_0-token_DemoRoot0</key>
    <!-- You can leave out the PIN here to type it in manually each time from HTML Mason -->
    <pin>123456</pin>
</token>
</pre>

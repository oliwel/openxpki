== Cleaning up left-over temp files ==

Temporary files OpenXPKI creates are sometimes not properly removed after use. In order to clean up left-over files regularly you can use the following script. The script assumes OpenXPKI is running as unix user openxpki and the web server is running as wwwown.

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup old and unused files

logger "Cleaning up old tmp files"
find /var/tmp/ -name 'openxpki*' -user openxpki -type f -mtime +10 -exec rm {} \;
find /var/tmp/ -name '[0-9A-F]*.pem' -user openxpki -type f -mtime +10 -exec rm {} \;
logger "Cleaning up old OpenXPKI session files"
find /var/openxpki/session/ -user openxpki -name 'cgisess*' -type f -mtime +10 -exec rm {} \; 
find /tmp -name 'cgisess*' -user wwwown -type f -mtime +10 -exec rm {} \; 
</pre>

== Auto-Approval of CERT requests ==

Q: Microsoft CA services provides a feature "Auto Certificate Approval". In this
feature, if we request a certificate then it is automatically approved. Please
guide me that how can we use OpenXPKI for automatic certificate approval as give
n in Microsoft CA services?

A: If you wish to enable auto-approval for normal cert requests (done via the web i
nterface) you need to modify the workflow definition:

=== workflow_def_certificate_signing_request.xml ===

Bypass the cert request edit and approval states. Original (from default config):
  ...
  <state name="PKCS10_GENERATED" autorun="yes">
    <action name="notify_user_of_creation"
            resulting_state="PENDING">
    </action>
  </state>
  ...
Change the resulting_state to PERSIST_CSR:                                      
  ...
  <state name="PKCS10_GENERATED" autorun="yes">
    <action name="notify_user_of_creation"
            resulting_state="PERSIST_CSR">
    </action>
  </state>
  ...
After this state add a new state to the workflow definition:
  <state name="PERSIST_CSR" autorun="yes">
    <action name="I18N_OPENXPKI_WF_ACTION_PERSIST_CSR"
            resulting_state="SPAWNING_CERT_ISSUANCE">
    </action>
  </state>
Leave the rest as it is. Restart the daemon to activate the change.

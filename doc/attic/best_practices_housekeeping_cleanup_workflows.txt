== Clean up superfluous workflow instances and related meta data ==

Heavily loaded SCEP server instances can produce huge amounts of SCEP workflow instances, in particular if the actual SCEP request fails. In this case every single SCEP request creates a SCEP workflow instance which is left in status FAILURE. Nobody needs these instances after a few days (possibly they are useful immediately after reception for debugging purposes).

In order to clean up these superfluous workflow instances the following SQL statements can be used to wipe all unwanted workflow instances and all related data (workflow context and workflow history).

Assumptions:
* Database is Oracle
* OpenXPKI schema user is 'l2openxpki'
* Failed SCEP workflow instances should be kept for one month

<pre>
-- delete all SCEP workflows in FAILURE older than one month
delete from l2openxpki.workflow 
  where workflow_type = 'I18N_OPENXPKI_WF_TYPE_SCEP_REQUEST' 
  and workflow_state = 'FAILURE' 
  and workflow_last_update < (select to_char(add_months(sysdate, -1), 'YYYY-MM-DD') from dual);

-- now we have dangling workflow contexts and workflow history, clean up
delete from l2openxpki.workflow_history 
  where workflow_id in (
    select distinct l2openxpki.workflow_history.workflow_id 
      from l2openxpki.workflow_history left outer join l2openxpki.workflow 
      on l2openxpki.workflow_history.workflow_id = l2openxpki.workflow.workflow_id 
        where l2openxpki.workflow.workflow_id is NULL
  );

delete from l2openxpki.workflow_context 
  where workflow_id in (
    select distinct l2openxpki.workflow_context.workflow_id 
      from l2openxpki.workflow_context left outer join l2openxpki.workflow 
      on l2openxpki.workflow_context.workflow_id = l2openxpki.workflow.workflow_id 
        where l2openxpki.workflow.workflow_id is NULL
);

commit;
</pre>

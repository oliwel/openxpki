==Using the Live CD==

'''Note: this is work-in-progress, so your mileage may vary'''

'''Note 2: during initial testing, the Debian packages are on build0.cynops.de, which is a development host and has no SLAs. After testing, the packages will move to a more appropriate location.'''

The Live CD provides a simple start for testing and evaluating OpenXPKI. In addition, it may be customized for use as an offline Root CA.

==Customizing the Live CD==

The Live CD is based on Morphix (http://www.morphix.org), which itself is based on Debian (http://www.debian.org). In the main SVN trunk, see trunk/package/morphix-lenny/README for more details.
